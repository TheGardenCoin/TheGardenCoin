The Garden is an ecosystem on the Binance Smart Blockchain and a place
that lets you enjoy your favourite Defi games/projects all in one place without the fear of being
rugged.
The Binance Smart Chain offers a wide variety of Defi projects.
It often happens that these Defi projects rug pull on their investors.
We at The Garden are planning to stop this by building secure and trustable decentralized
applications where users can invest in peace, without the fear of being rugged on.
Our ecosystem runs on The Garden Coin(TGC), a coin that is designed to participate in
the Garden ecosystem.
The recommended exchange for trading The Garden Coin (TGC) is going to be pancakeswap.
It is important to always cross-check the token address against the TGC address provided on
thegarden.finance, as there is going to be many scams and fake TGC after being listed.
After you bought your TGC you can participate in one of Defi games.
Each game will have his own documentation and explanation, it's critical to read these through
before entering a game.
The more people enter the ecosystem and start playing our games, the more positive this will be
for the price of TGC.
